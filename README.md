# 2D Printer Cabinet

## Summary
I built this printer cabinet to deal with the mess associated with having multiple printers and all their associated supplies. 

The first slot holds an Epson XP15000 and is on drawer slides to allow access to the back of the machine and rear paper feed. The drawers hold ink, parts, paper, and labels. On top, we keep a larger printer specifically set up for printing dye-sublimation transfer graphics.
